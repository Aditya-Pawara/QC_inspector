            "description": "Due to the severe external packaging damage, the white expanded polystyrene (Styrofoam) protective insert is clearly visible. It appears to be compressed, fractured, and potentially broken in the exposed area, indicating a significant loss of its shock-absorbing and protective capabilities.",

This exposure renders the product vulnerable to direct impact, scratches, dust, moisture, and other environmental contaminants.",

            "description": "Given the severity of the packaging damage and the direct exposure of the internal product, there is a very high probability of direct physical damage (e.g., dents, scratches, internal component misalignment or breakage) to the appliance itself, which cannot be fully assessed without further inspection.",

        "Initiate an investigation into the root cause of the packaging damage (e.g., rough handling during loading/unloading, improper stacking, forklift impact, insufficient packaging material strength, inadequate strapping).",
        "Implement immediate corrective actions to prevent recurrence, such as improved handling procedures, enhanced training for logistics personnel, or a review of packaging design and materials.",
        "This unit should not be shipped or sold in its current condition. It must either be repaired, repackaged, or scrapped based on the findings of the internal product inspection."
